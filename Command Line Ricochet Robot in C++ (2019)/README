        make gorobots
    - run executable with
        ./gorobots boardFile

Files:

        Contains the client codes, take in information by command and use the
        Board and Tree classes to run the game.

        Contains the function definition of the Board class. Example of 
        functions: Print, Set_Robot, etc.

        of the functions in Board.cpp.

Data Structures:
    2-D Char Array:
        The board of the game is represented by a 2-D char array that store
        the walls in the array also. 
    Tree: 
        The tree class contains a tree of Nodes. The starting location of 
        the robot is inputted into the front node, and every direction the
        robot moves to will be a child of the previous node. 
        The struct of the Node contains the row and col int, a string with
        path to that node, and four Node pointers representing each direction.
