Goal: Fill the backpack to make it as valuable as possible without exceeding the maximum weight. 

Genome: An index representation of backpacks. 
        For example, a backpack of only box #1 is represented as [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Fringe Operations:
        - Mutation: Choose a random index in genome, if the corresponding box is in the set, 
                    take it away, if not in set, put it in. 
        - Crossover: Choose a random index in genome. Produce two child given two parents.
                     One child take first part of first parent and second part of second part, second child is the opposite. 


- For each new generation, the population is culled by 50%
- Then crossover and mutation is applied. 
- The genetic algorithm ends when there is only one genome left.
